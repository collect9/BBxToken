1. redeeming is a one way trip - cannot burn it either
2. eip-2981 doesn't seem to be working on rarible
-> default royalty was not picking for address 0 or invalid token id
-> do i need to specify type(IERC2981).interfaceId in supportsInterface?

working:
1. token redeemer, goes all the way through redeem and gets locked
2. token upgrader, upgrades successfully
